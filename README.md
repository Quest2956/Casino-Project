# **Interactive Casino**  
The **Interactive Casino** is a C programming project that simulates the thrill of a virtual casino environment. It features four classic casino gamesâ€”Roulette, Blackjack, Slots, and Coin Flip, allowing users to place bets, test their luck, and manage their virtual balance. This project showcases modular programming, dynamic memory management, and random number generation in C.  

## **Project Features**  
- **Roulette**: Bet on a number between 0 and 18. Win 18x the bet for correct guesses.  
- **Blackjack**: Compete against the dealer to achieve a higher card value without exceeding 21.  
- **Slots**: Spin three reels and win based on matching patterns, including a jackpot for all three matching.  
- **Coin Flip**: Bet on heads or tails, and double your bet on a correct guess.  

## **Contribution**  
### **Slots Game**  
As a contributor to the Interactive Casino project, I was responsible for implementing the Slots game function. My tasks included:

- Designing the mechanics for the Slots game, including rules for betting, spinning, and winning.
- Using `rand()` seeded with `srand(time(NULL))` to generate random slot results for three reels, ensuring fairness and unpredictability.
- Implementing game rules:
- Jackpot Rule: Winning 10x the bet for three matching reels.
- Partial Match Rule: Winning half the bet for two matching reels.
- No Match Rule: Losing the bet for no matches.
- Managing and updating the player's balance dynamically using pointer arithmetic.
- Creating user-friendly prompts and detailed feedback messages to enhance the player's experience.
- Ensuring input validation to prevent invalid bets or entries.
- This module demonstrates key programming concepts such as randomization, input validation, and dynamic memory management in C.

### **Code Snippet**
```
void slots(int *balance)
{
    int bet, s1, s2, s3;

    printf("<---SLOTS--->\n\n");
    printf("Rules for Slots.\n");
    printf("1. Betting Rule: The player must place a bet before spinning the slots. The bet cannot exceed their current balance or be less than or equal to zero.\n");
    printf("2. Slot Spin: Three random values are generated for the three slots (ranging from 0 to 10), and the results are displayed to the player.\n");
    printf("3. Jackpot Rule: If all three slots match (e.g., 3 | 3 | 3), the player wins the jackpot and receives 10 times the amount they bet.\n");
    printf("4. Partial Match Rule: If any two slots match (e.g., 3 | 3 | 1), the player wins half their bet.\n");
    printf("5. No Match Rule: If none of the slots match (e.g., 3 | 1 | 2), the player loses their bet, and their balance is reduced accordingly.\n\n");

    printf("Enter your bet: ");
    scanf("%d", &bet);

    if (bet > *balance || bet <= 0) 
    {
        printf("Invalid bet amount. Please try again.\n\n");
        return;
    }

    s1 = rand() % 11;
    s2 = rand() % 11;
    s3 = rand() % 11;

    printf("Slot Results: %d | %d | %d\n", s1,s2,s3);

    if (s1 == s2 && s2 == s3)
    {
        printf("Congratulations! You won a JACKPOT!!!\n");
        *balance = *balance + bet * 10;
    }
    else if (s1 == s2 || s2 == s3 || s1 == s3)
    {
        printf("Congrats! You win half your bet!\n");
        *balance = *balance + bet / 2;
    }
    else
    {
        printf("You lose. Better luck next time!\n");
        *balance = *balance - bet;
    }

    show_bal(*balance);
}
```

## **How to Run the Program**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/xstolas/interactive-casino.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd interactive-casino
   ```  
3. Compile the program using GCC or another C compiler:  
   ```bash  
   gcc casino.c -o casino  
   ```  
4. Run the program:  
   ```bash  
   ./casino  
   ```  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: C  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `<stdio.h>`: Input and output functions  
  - `<stdlib.h>`: Random number generation and memory management  
  - `<time.h>`: Seeding the random number generator with system time
